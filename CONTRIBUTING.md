# Contributing to Tensorlayer

We are using pep8 coding style and numpy doc style.

The following tools are used to ensure that we comply the convention:

* yapf (format code)
* isort (sort imports)
* autoflake (remove unused imports)

Please run them for the changed files before you make a commit.

yapf is now enforced in our travis-ci test, and we are moving to enforce pydocstyle in the future.
